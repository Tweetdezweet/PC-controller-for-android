# PC-controller-for-android
Android app to remote control your pc (running windows and needs to have service installed)

This prototype Android app allows the user to send keystrokes to his computer which should be running the required service (https://github.com/Tweetdezweet/Remote-Control-Listening-Service)
As this is a prototype a LAN ip is hardcoded, a releasable version should of course include a settings page or another way to select the IP of the computer the user wishes to control.
